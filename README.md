# Something about Pol Lara Cavaye

Hi, I'm Pol Lara Cavay√©. I am currently about to finish my Physics degree at the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB), since I only have my final degree project to finish.

Before entering the Physics degree, I also studied the first year of the Mathematics degree at the UAB, but my interest in and curiosity about Physics made me change my career.
The branches of the physical sciences that most attract me are particle physics and ionizing radiation physics: studying them in depth in the last years of my degree opened up a world of which I can say that I like physics. Another very general branch of its applications is that of simulations: from being able to perform integrals that are analytically impossible to solve, to simulating the behavior of a radioactive cloud according to the wind, it opened another door for me (the programing).

During my years at university I have learned that the best way to learn is to seek life for oneself, with all that it implies: looking for information on the internet, books, classmates, etc. I have seen this aptitude reflected in the world of programming, where I think that knowing how to search and find is the key to programming. Together with a knowledge base and a strategic mindset to carry out a program, incredible things can be achieved.
